# model-finder

This program can used to validate and/or verify models given as .ecore and .ocl files. The basement has been developed during my PhD time in the [Group of Computer Architecture](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/agra/eng/index.php) of the [University of Bremen](http://www.uni-bremen.de) between April 2013 and March 2017. Most parts of the code are written by myself, however, also other people contributed to it. For example, [Mathias Soeken](https://github.com/msoeken) provided an architecture and first code snippets, [Oliver Keszöcze](https://github.com/keszocze) helped to implement the interface to [metaSMT](https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/metaSMT), Patrick Röhrs extended the functionality at several positions where the development before was only example-driven, Philipp Niemann helped to realise the first version of parameter support for operations.

An installation manual can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/przigoda/model-finder/wiki/Installation).

Some description for the different use cases shall follow in the near future.
